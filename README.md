# Offybox V2 API

## Overview
This project is a mini-aspire API designed to guide authenticated users through a comprehensive loan application process. The API provides the following functionalities:

1. **Creating Loan Applications:**
   - Users can create loan applications by providing the minimum required information to calculate their loan eligibility.

2. **Allocating Loans for Approval:**
   - The system allocates loans to employees for approval. If the approved amount exceeds the eligible amount, an override request must be made.

3. **Fetching Application List:**
   - Both users and employees can fetch a list of their respective loan applications.

4. **Viewing Loan Details:**
   - Users can view detailed loan information, including interest rates, principal outstanding, and EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) outstanding.

5. **Loan Approval by Employees:**
   - Employees can approve loan applications. This endpoint is restricted for user type "customer." During the approval process, if the approved amount is greater than the eligible amount, the employee must approve the amount with an override. The system will then recalculate the repayment schedule for the application.

6. **Making Repayments:**
   - Users can make repayments, which will adjust the outstanding amount and settle installments based on the payment amount.

These features are designed to ensure a streamlined and efficient loan management process, from application creation to approval and repayment.
## Features
- Loan application creation and participant management
- Loan approval and override request handling
- Repayment schedule generation
- Loan details viewing
- Repayment processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.20 or later
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://infopack.co.in/offybox.git
    cd aspire-lms
    ```

2. Copy the example environment file and edit as needed:
    ```sh
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    go mod download
    ```
### Running the Application
1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

2. Alternatively, you can use Docker:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

### Environment Variables
- `ENV=development`: The application environment (e.g., development, production).

## Postman Collection

A Postman collection is provided to test the API endpoints. You can import the collection into Postman using the following steps:

1. Open Postman.
2. Click on the Import button.
3. Select the `Aspire LMS.postman_collection.json` file from the root of the project directory.
4. Click Import to add the collection to your Postman workspace.

Now you can use the collection to test the different API endpoints. The collection includes requests for:

- Application Create
- Application List
- Approve Application
- Auth - Employee
- Auth - Customer
- Application Detail
- Repayment

You can find the Postman collection file in the collection directory.

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

The following command are used to generate mock services:
- mockgen -source=app/services/loan/service.go -destination=app/services/loan/mock_loan_service.go -package=loan_service
- mockgen -source=app/services/user/service.go -destination=app/services/user/mock_user_service.go -package=user_service
- mockgen -source=app/services/repayment/service.go -destination=app/services/repayment/mock_repayment_service.go -package=repayment_service

To run unit tests for the controllers, you can use the following command:
```bash
go test ./app/controllers/...
